# Features Folder Refactoring Tasks

## Phase 1: Structure Analysis Complete ✅
- [x] Analyzed current features folder structure
- [x] Identified structural issues and inconsistencies  
- [x] Documented improvement recommendations

## Phase 2: Common Folder Consolidation

### Task 2.1: Reorganize Common Structure
- [ ] Create standardized common folder structure:
  ```
  common/
  ├── components/
  ├── hooks/
  ├── types/
  ├── utils/
  ├── constants/
  └── styles/
  ```
- [ ] Move scattered common files into organized structure
- [ ] Update import paths in affected files
- [ ] Remove empty directories after moves

### Task 2.2: Clean Up Common Index Files
- [ ] Review and populate empty `common/types/index.ts`
- [ ] Standardize `common/utils/index.ts` exports
- [ ] Update main `common/index.ts` to reflect new structure
- [ ] Ensure consistent export patterns across common modules

## Phase 3: Feature Structure Standardization

### Task 3.1: Standardize Vibes Feature
- [ ] Flatten `vibes/components/modals/base/` → `vibes/components/`
- [ ] Flatten `vibes/components/popups/` → `vibes/components/`
- [ ] Move `vibes/demo/` to appropriate location or remove if unused
- [ ] Update import paths throughout vibes feature
- [ ] Clean up empty directories

### Task 3.2: Standardize Profile Feature  
- [ ] Consolidate `profile/map/` functionality into main profile structure
- [ ] Flatten nested `profile/components/` subdirectories where appropriate
- [ ] Reorganize profile hooks and utilities
- [ ] Update import paths throughout profile feature
- [ ] Remove redundant directory layers

### Task 3.3: Standardize Map Feature
- [ ] Review `map/interactive-map/` nesting necessity
- [ ] Organize map types and utilities consistently
- [ ] Ensure clean separation from profile map functionality
- [ ] Update import paths as needed

### Task 3.4: Review Other Features
- [ ] Standardize `file-storage/` structure (minimal changes needed)
- [ ] Review `admin/` feature organization
- [ ] Ensure `dev/` feature follows conventions or relocate

## Phase 4: Import Boundary Enforcement

### Task 4.1: Audit Cross-Feature Dependencies
- [ ] Document all current cross-feature imports (found 10+ files with `../../` imports)
- [ ] Identify which dependencies are legitimate vs coupling issues
- [ ] Plan refactoring strategy for problematic dependencies

### Task 4.2: Eliminate Direct Feature-to-Feature Imports  
- [ ] Refactor vibes → profile direct imports
- [ ] Refactor map → vibes direct imports
- [ ] Move shared functionality to common/ where appropriate
- [ ] Implement dependency injection patterns where needed

### Task 4.3: Create Clear Public APIs
- [ ] Define public API for each feature in index.ts
- [ ] Ensure features only expose necessary functionality
- [ ] Document intended usage patterns for each feature
- [ ] Add TypeScript strict mode compliance where missing

## Phase 5: Index File Standardization

### Task 5.1: Remove Empty Index Files
- [ ] Remove or populate `vibes/types/index.ts` (0 lines)
- [ ] Remove or populate `vibes/components/modals/base/index.ts` (0 lines)
- [ ] Review other minimal index files for necessity

### Task 5.2: Standardize Export Patterns
- [ ] Choose consistent export strategy (named vs star exports)
- [ ] Update all index files to follow chosen pattern
- [ ] Ensure proper re-export hierarchies
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for public APIs where beneficial

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation

### Task 6.1: Validate Refactoring
- [ ] Run TypeScript compilation to catch import issues
- [ ] Run test suite to ensure no functionality broken
- [ ] Verify all features still work correctly
- [ ] Check bundle size impact of changes

### Task 6.2: Update Documentation
- [ ] Update any documentation referencing old structure
- [ ] Document new feature organization conventions
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines for feature structure
- [ ] Update import examples in README/docs

## Phase 7: Optional Enhancements

### Task 7.1: Advanced Improvements
- [ ] Consider implementing feature flags/lazy loading
- [ ] Add automated linting rules for import boundaries
- [ ] Implement barrel export optimization
- [ ] Consider monorepo-style workspace organization

### Task 7.2: Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Analyze bundle splitting opportunities by feature
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports for non-critical features
- [ ] Review and optimize re-export chains
- [ ] Consider tree-shaking implications of structure

## Priority Levels
- **High Priority**: Tasks 2.1, 3.1, 4.2 (Core structural issues)
- **Medium Priority**: Tasks 2.2, 3.2, 3.3, 5.1 (Consistency improvements)  
- **Low Priority**: Tasks 4.1, 5.2, 6.2, 7.x (Polish and optimization)

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: File moves within features, index file updates
- **Medium Risk**: Cross-feature import refactoring
- **High Risk**: Major structural changes affecting multiple features

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: ✅ Complete
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours
- Phase 3: 4-6 hours  
- Phase 4: 3-4 hours
- Phase 5: 1-2 hours
- Phase 6: 1-2 hours
- Phase 7: 2-4 hours (optional)

**Total Estimated Time: 13-22 hours**
